## Why another compliance platform?

We build Probo for three reasons:

**Existing solutions are behind a paywall and too expensive.** Compliance frameworks often push good practices, the security measures should be accessible to all.

**Reinvent the journey.** We want to start from scratch, exploiting past issues to craft a new experience.

**We believe in Open-source and community.** It impacts almost all companies, the whole ecosystem should benefit from it. 

## What can you do with Probo today?
Not much yet. But it is only the beginning of the journey.
So far, you have access to **all the security measures necessary to prepare a SOC 2 audit**. 

Soon, we will add:
- End-to-end platform
- Personnalized policy generation (based on the security measure implemented)
- Integration with Google Workplaces, Github, GCP & AWS
- Support for ISO 27001 and GDPR
