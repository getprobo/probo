# Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

## Purpose

Disasters might seem far-fetched, but data loss, service outages, and
misconfigurations can happen. Whether it's a simple human error or a regional
outage, a DRP helps your team recover fast and maintain customer trust.

## Implementation

Here is a basic template, to use as a good starting point:

If it is easier to manage, you can have several DRP: one for your database, one
for your network, one for your infra, etcâ€¦ that way, when testing, you can test
smaller part of it and it adapts better to potential real life events.

</aside>

The idea is to be prepared for the unexpected. You donâ€™t need to overthink
things, itâ€™s more to know what to do when you will be in the rush of a regional
outage. For that, your DRP needs to cover:

1. **Scope & timings**: clear scope and the expected time to do it
2. **Step-by-step:** guide on how to proceed
3. **Contacts**: list of internal and external contacts crucial during a
   disaster.
4. **Testing and Review Log**: A record of tests performed to validate the DRPâ€™s
   effectiveness and any improvements made.
